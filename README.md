# -Optimizing-Sentiment-Prediction-with-LSTM-BiLSTM-and-GRU-Models
Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing have significantly improved sentiment analysis through the use of deep learning models. This study conducts a comparative analysis of three leading RNN architectures: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU.

We evaluated the performance of each architecture using two distinct datasets:
The IMDB movie review dataset, containing 50,000 samples. The TripAdvisor hotel review dataset, comprising 20,000 samples. Our analysis focuses on four key performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The goal is to identify the most effective model architecture for sentiment analysis tasks, exploring how each model performs in different sentiment analysis contexts.
